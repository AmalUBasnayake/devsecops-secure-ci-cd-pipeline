# 🔐 DevSecOps Secure CI/CD Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** where security is integrated early into the development lifecycle using **GitHub Actions**.

The goal of this project is to showcase **shift-left security**, automation, and the collaboration between Development, Security, and Operations.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web Application)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Bash Scripting (Security Checks)
- DevSecOps Principles

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation
- Automated security checks triggered on every code push
- Detection of hardcoded secrets (demo-level security scan)
- Early identification of security risks before deployment

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically
3. Security checks are executed
4. Pipeline completes with logs and status
